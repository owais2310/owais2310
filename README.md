A passionate student at Punjab College currently navigating the exciting world of DevOps. I'm in my intermediate studies and eager to learn and contribute to the tech community.

**What I'm Currently Exploring:**

- ☁️ Cloud Technologies (Azure, AWS - still figuring out my favorite!)
- ⚙️ Automation Tools (Ansible, maybe some Terraform soon?)
- 🐳 Containerization (Docker is fascinating!)
- 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines (Learning the magic behind seamless deployments)
- 💻 Scripting (Python is my go-to for now)
- 🐧 Linux Fundamentals (Getting comfortable in the terminal)

**My Goals:**

- Build a solid foundation in DevOps principles and practices.
- Contribute to open-source projects (someday!).
- Learn from experienced professionals in the field.
- Eventually automate all the things! 😉

**Fun Fact:**

- When I'm not diving into the world of DevOps, you can probably find me leveling up in my favorite games. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even automate game deployments! 😉

**Thanks for stopping by!** 😊
